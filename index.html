    <h3>Nathan: <br>I spent this week mostly watching. I brainstormed with Bill for a bit about what we wanted to do, and we started making a list of the stuff we wanted to be in our film. Eventually, we will cut down the wish list to a list of things that we can actually afford to put into our film (with time and resource constraints and all). The list is in the &#8217;Brainstorming&#8217; document in our shared folder. I watched a few 20 minute silent films, and those were very interesting because of how much the actors had to pantomime to get their points across. They were surprisingly effective, and I have a weird newfound respect for silent films now. I also watched parts of Enter the Dragon (with Bruce Lee), since I wanted some inspiration for an action sequence. I wasn&#8217;t really a fan of how there wasn&#8217;t much buildup in the fight scenes, and how Bruce Lee almost always instantly won. If Bill and I were to do an action scene, I would probably go for more of an even fight with more motives.<br><br>Bill: <br>This week, I focused on one film in particular, Ikiru. While not filled with action shots, this Kurosawa film focused on a man who was diagnosed with terminal cancer who tries to find meaning in the numbered days he has left. I was able to find some interesting shots that I thought could be implemented into our own film as well as those I found to just be all-around effective. Shots that use a mirror to be able to see front-facing views on both characters while they are directly facing each other and the use of a jungle gym as a prison proves incredibly effective and something we can aspire to have in our own film. Along with Nathan, we also watched some silent films and gained an appreciation for expression without words (some of the films went a little far to a point of comedy, and that&#8217s not for us, but the point is still there). As Nathan stated, we spent some time brainstorming on ideas and coming up with a general direction. We have already expressed interest in logistics of our film (such as having an action scene and focusing less on dialogue) and feel confident in our ability to compose a fully-fledged proposal by Friday.

    <h3>Bill:<br>This week, Nathan and I have developed the framework for how we want our project to look like, including pinpointing certain scenes we want to try and implement into our film. Challenges such as giving the impression of a moving car without having to drive ourselves, telling plot and emotion through movement and not dialogue, and the usage of more advanced film techniques such as shutter speed and aperture to get the exact shot we want. I have further immersed myself in watching film. Knowing certain shots I want, it&#8217;s been easier to pinpoint screen captures that I know I can draw inspiration from (see &#8220;Better Luck Tomorrow&#8220;), but I also pay attention to shots I find good overall. <br><br>Nathan:<br>It&#8217;s been a productive week. We settled on a good idea and we have a very clear vision of what we want certain key shots to be like. Like Bill said above, we got quite a few good ideas for shots in the car. I&#8217;m thinking of taking footage from the same camera angle and overlaying them to get the &#8220;moving&#8220; effect (replace Mr. Kelman moving with Bill pretending to be driving, but keeping the windows moving)

    <h3>Bill<br>This week was mostly about visualizing the plot and making preparations for our first shoot. We&#8217;ve been considering actors and their schedules, places to film, and anticipating obstacles we may encounter in our first shoot while coming up with solutions now. One of the biggest obstacles we foresaw was giving the impression of a moving car from the inside without needing an actor to actually drive the car. To do this, we decided to film someone else (breaking the persona, but that&#8217;ll be you, Mr. Kelman) driving the car and using the actual motion of the car (window movement, sound of car moving, etc.) to hide the actual stillness. Another thing we discussed was how this scene would be shot at nighttime and how that would call for a change in the way our camera functions. We tested a bit with the aperture and shutter speed to find the settings that made sense for us on an outside road that likely would have artificial lighting from lamp posts or house light. We have yet to test this with the inside of a car when it&#8217;s night outside.<br><br>Nathan<br>I&#8217;ve been thinking about how serious this film could be. We could take two approaches: One is a lighthearted film capitalizing on the humor that we can draw from different characters (the narcissistic drunk driver for example). Or we could take a different approach and have a film with minimal dialogue, with a bunch of close up shots and clear sound effects telling the story. The plot still needs some hammering down near the beginning and the end, but I think that we&#8217;re making good progress. We aim to begin filming by next weekend.

    <h3>Nathan<br>This week Bill and I made some really good progress. We storyboarded and planned all week, and on Saturday night we filmed with Mr. Kelman (you). We didn&#8217;t get all of the shots we wanted; we wanted to get shots from inside the car too, but we can do that another time. We came up with some pretty creative ways to get around a few filming restrictions, like the dummy. I watched Son of a Gun, and there were some nice shots there that I enjoyed too.<br><br>Bill<br>This week marked the first of many important shoots. Apart from scripting future scenes (see Script 4) and a bit of storyboarding, preparations for the shoot on Saturday night was the majority of work done on the project. This included purchasing a suitable canister of beer (Canada Dry), making it look like some beer (wrapping paper), and picking a good time. This included setting up a good time for our actor, Zayd, as well as our car donor, you, to meet.

    <h3>Nathan<br>This week Bill and I slowed down a little bit due to the wacky scheduling. We grinded out the entirety of the largest act of the movie (the scenes including the car), so the toughest shooting is out of the way. We are now going to finish scripting the rest of the movie and start shooting small scenes in many different locations, so we&#8217;ll have to carve out little chunks of time throughout the weeks. Overall, we&#8217;re good on progress. I&#8217;ve started a little bit of editing for the scenes that we have, but I haven&#8217;t really done that much yet. Weâ€™re going to finish scripting then figure out the best shooting schedule for the both of us. I also have a feeling that Avengers: Endgame (which we are watching on Friday!) will give me some inspiration for really cool shots.<br><br>Bill<br>This week was so weird! With Non Sibi day and the USAMO, there hasn&#8217;t been too much going on this week. However, we did complete a shoot inside the car, which is arguably one of our hardest and most convoluted scenes. We have continued our scripting (see Script 5/6) an storyboarding. Avengers: Endgame is coming up! Let&#8217;s hope we&#8217;re inspired a little.

    <h3>Nathan<br>We brainstormed and scripted quite a bit this week, even though we didn&#8217;t shoot. By now, the majority of the plot has been developed, with only the ending remaining unclear. We&#8217;re watching Avengers: Endgame tonight, actually (Friday), so I&#8217;m hoping that we get plenty of inspiration. We may shoot a scene in the graveyard this weekend (if it rains).<br><br>Bill<br>We took it a little slower this week. Even though there were no additional shots being made, we pinpointed problems in our existing footage such as lighting issues and have plans for potential reshooting. We&#8217;ve also been consulting weather forecasts in order to see when it&#8217;s going to rain, as we want our graveyard scene to take place with a downpour. We&#8217;ve continued our scripting process (and are getting extremely close to finishing) and are excited to watch Avengers: Endgame. The shots will hopefully live up to the hype, especially considering that it has 97% on Rotten Tomatoes!

We probably only need 2 or 3 more quick shoots before we&#8217;re ready for post-production. Unfortunately we couldn&#8217;t film over the weekend, as Bill was in NYC for class.<br><br>Bill<br> With another shot out of the way and a completed script, we're ticking off the boxes quickly. At this point, we are confident in our ability to see our vision by the end of the term with few shots to go and the editing we have in front of us. There was no filming during this weekend due to my trip, however.

We had an unfortunate setback with filming this week, but we&#8217;ll plan and reschedule accordingly. Hopefully we can wrap up filming in the beginning of next week and devote our time fully to editing.<br><br>Bill<br>Filming is very much on the way. With some scenes preemptively edited and other scenes having being shot (or failed to be shot due to some issues with our actors), our film has finally begun to take a visual shape. Filming is anticipated to be completed this week (spilling just a little into the following week if we feel that to be necessary) and editing should not be too big an undertaking, so all in all I think we are in good shape and set up for success.

We plan to spend the last three nights before the deadline splicing everything together.<br><br>Bill<br> There was an unfortunate re-shoot that needed to happen this week during the crash scene, but fortunately all parties involved were ready on the Thursday to get it done. Apart from that, we had some additional shots that we wanted to take and have begun to properly edit certain parts of the film. I suspect that more glaring problems will show themselves during the editing process, however.
